 Tokamak: JET

 Pulse number: 53212

 Shot description,purpose of the shot: 
   ELMy with high field side pellet fueling for high density

 Contact persons: Robert Budny, (budny@princeton.edu)  Jef Ongena, Xavier Garbet

 Institution:  EFDA-JET

 Date of shot: 20010122

 Time of interest = 20.8s (60.8s in JET PPF time) for steady state

 Analysis codes: TRANSP and EFIT (for plasma boundary)

 Run number: 53212C01 at PPPL, available from mdsplus

 Date of analysis: 20051103 TRANSP run by Robert Budny
   Resubmission corecting NM4

 Assumptions made for analysis:

  Ti, toroidal rotation velocity, and Zeff profiles from CX measurements.
  Both the core (CXSM) and edge (CXSE) measurements were combined.
  Te and Ne profiles vs. radius from LIDAR measurements.
  The radiation emission profile was assumed to be flat.
  Particle confinement time is calculated from source rates.
  q profile calculated in TRANSP from poloidal field diffusion.

 Additional information:

  Pulse #53212 had multiple pellets launched from the high field side.

  The Ti, rotation, and Zeff profiles were measured from 16 to 25.4s.
  between R=3.05 and 3.80m.

  The direction of the toroidal field and plasma current were in the
  normal JET direction - clockwise viewed from above.
  The NBI voltages were 138 keV for 7 beams and 80keV for 8.

  All beam related quantities (energy, particle sources, currents etc) 
  have been smoothed to suppress Monte-Carlo noise. 
  In the 2d file the trace hydrogen is stored in NM1, deuterium in NM2
  and trace T in NM2. 
  NM4 contains the carbon density being the majority impurity species. 

  In the file JET_53212_0d.dat data is given at 20.8 secs. 

  Values for kappa and delta in the 0d, 1d and 2d files are from the TRANSP
  output derived from the boundary input definition provided by EFIT.
  kappa = (Zmax-Zmin)/(Rmax-Rmin),   delta = (RGEO - min(R(zmin),R(Zmax)))/a
  XPLIM and SEPLIM are given by EFIT.
  as defined in the standard list of variables.  
  
  The TRANSP run gives a simulated W_dia 15% above the measured value
  and a neutron emission rate OK at early peak, bit high later.
